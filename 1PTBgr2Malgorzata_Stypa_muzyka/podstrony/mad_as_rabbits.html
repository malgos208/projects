		<br><br><b>MAD AS RABBITS</b>
		<br><br>
<p>Come save me from walking off a window sill
<br>Or I'll sleep in the rain
<br>Don't you remember when I was a bird
<br>And you were a map?

<p>And now he drags down miles in America
<br>Briefcase in hand
<br>The stove is creeping up his spine again
<br>Can't get enough trash

<p>[Chorus]
<br>He took the days for pageant
<br>Became as mad as rabbits
<br>With bushels of bad habits
<br>And who could ask for anymore?
<br>Yeah, who could have more?

<p>His arms were the branches of a Christmas tree
<br>Preached the devil in the belfry
<br>He checked in to learn his clothes had been thieved
<br>At the train station

<p>The rope hung his other branch
<br>And at the end was a dog called Bambi
<br>Who was chewing on his parliaments
<br>When he tried to save the calendar business
<br>He tried to save the calendar business
<p>
<div class="img_left"><img src="../img/mad2.jpg"></div>
<p>[Chorus]
<br>He took the days for pageant
<br>And became as mad as rabbits
<br>With bushels of bad habits
<br>Who could ask for anymore?
<br>Who could have more?

<p>The poor son of a humble chimney sweep
<br>Fell to a cheap crowd
<br>So stay asleep and put on that cursive type
<br>You know we live in a toy

<p>You know that Paul Cates
<br>Bought himself a trumpet from the Salvation Army
<br>But there ain't no sunshine in his song
<br>We must reinvent love, reinvent love
<br>Reinvent love

<p>[Chorus]
<br>He took the days for pageant
<br>And became as mad as rabbits
<br>With bushels of bad habits
<br>Who could ask for anymore?
<br>Yeah, who could have more?

<p>We must reinvent love
<br>Reinvent love
<br>Reinvent love
